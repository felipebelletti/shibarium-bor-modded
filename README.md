# Speed-Optimized Shibarium Bor Client

This repository houses an optimized version focusing on sniping strategies of the Shibarium Bor Client, featuring a suite of enhancements aimed at improving network interaction and transaction processing efficiency.

## Features

- **Enhanced Peer Metrics**: Improved data gathering from peers within the network, providing deeper insights and better network management.
  
- **Refined Transaction Broadcast**: Streamlined broadcasting mechanism to enhance transaction propagation across the network.

- **Subscription for Full Pending Transaction Bodies**: Added functionality to subscribe to and filter full pending transaction bodies, allowing for a more robust handling of unconfirmed transactions.

## Important Note

- While this fork prioritizes speed and performance efficiency, it's important to note that some security features may be less emphasized as a result. Users should consider this trade-off and take additional precautions as necessary when using this client in a production environment.

- This mod is no longer actively maintained. After a period of development and use, it is being made public for others to use, modify, and potentially improve upon. While this repository might not receive updates or support, contributions and forks are welcome.
